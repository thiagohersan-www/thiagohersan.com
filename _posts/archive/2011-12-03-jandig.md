This was an interesting collaboration with VJ Pixel and other people at **memeLab**.

Jandig is a platform/installation for creating temporary exhibitions of digital or digitalized works or messages. Through the use of an [augmented reality library](http://code.google.com/p/andar/){:target="_blank"}, users can use their own phones to view these virtual works distributed throughout a physical environment.

For our very first installation, we made small black and white paper markers and glued them throughout the Santa Cecilia neighborhood of downtown SÃ£o Paulo.

When viewed through the software, these markers changed into photographs or drawings that were submitted to the Jandig open-source digital work database.

I was mostly responsible for writing the Java code for the Android application. This involved modifying/fixing the [AndAR](http://code.google.com/p/andar/){:target="_blank"} code and integrating it into a system that could recognize multiple markers and display pre-selected 2D images.

I was also responsible for figuring out how to display animated GIFs using OpenGL textures:
