In May of 2011 I helped my friend [Lizzy DeVita](http://lizzydevita.com/){:target="_blank"} with one of her pieces at the Affordable Art Fair in New York.

UN_TIT_LED is a 9&#8242; x 14&#8242; installation made up of a large image print, and a series of push lights organized to spell out a phrase in braille.

From her site: "Each light was pre-programmed to react differently when touched â€” some would respond immediately, while others had a delayed response. Some would fade on and off on their own, while others when touched would turn on a different light down the line."

In addition to re-wiring all the lights to run on a few AC power supplies, I also used an Arduino and some simple transistor circuits to create the delays and fades used in some of the lights.
