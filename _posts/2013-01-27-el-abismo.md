*El Abismo* is part live performance, part construction of a collective memory of the events that took place during [The Mexican Spring of 2012](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_Soy_132){:target="_blank"}, built by those who participated in the manifestations.

The material was organized during a week-long workshop at the Live Performers Meeting 2013 - Mexico City, and the resulting archive was exhibited as a live performance during the same festival.
