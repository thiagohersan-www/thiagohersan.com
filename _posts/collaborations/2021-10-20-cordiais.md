Anonther project done in collaboration with [Mari Nagem](https://marinagem.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Cordiais is an online database that correlates historical paintings that depict Brazilian women with the results of a facial recognition algorithm that tries to measure their happiness, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, and fear.

{% include swipebox.html prefix="cordiais-site" %}

This quantitative data is transformed into rectangles whose areas represent the amount of each emotion relative to the size of the original work, leading to a form of color-block abstract paintings/data-visualization.

The database can be navigated on the project's website: [https://cordiais.marinagem.com](https://cordiais.marinagem.com){:target="_blank"}
