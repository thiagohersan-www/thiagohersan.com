When running, the Happy App simultaneously triggers the computer camera and records a screenshot every 15 seconds. The pictures taken by the camera are analyzed and a connection is made between the user's emotions and the content they are seeing on the computer.

the app can be downloaded for Mac and Windows on the project's website: [https://thehappyapp.art](https://thehappyapp.art){:target="_blank"}
