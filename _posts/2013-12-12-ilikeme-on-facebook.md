Who doesn't want to be famous?

Data is not just a part of today's commons, it's becoming its currency: literally, figuratively, socially. Good things shall come to those who share, like, post, poke, trend, pin, tweet...

iLikeMe (on facebook) is a self-promoting app and intervention platform for bumping someone's social-networking status.

It uses a real-time [face tracking library](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker){:target="_blank"} to generate exaggeratedly colored images in the style of Andy Warhol's silkscreens, that are then posted to facebook for 15 minutes straight, along with predictions about the future based on popular google searches.

This project is part of an ongoing [series](/ilikeyou-on-facebook/) of web [applications](/ulikeme-on-facebook/) meant to explore different aspects of our technology-mediated interactions.
