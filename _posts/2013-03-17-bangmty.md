This was version 2.0 of the *Arma Sonora Telemática*, which is a device/concept used to amplify and direct people's opinions from the internet to a physical space. It is a tool for voicing the collective discontent over the role of violence in Mexico's recent history.

In March of 2013, during a workshop at the [Nrmal Festival](http://www.nrmal.net/){:target="_blank"} in Monterrey, México, a shipping container was turned into a percussive sequencer using a motor and a system of hammers and pulleys, which were activated every time someone used the hashtag #BangMTY on Twitter.

Both versions of the AST can be easily replicated, modified and adapted by anyone who wants to create their own manifestations.
