Part performance, part product, this is a kind of exercise in exploring the relationship between language and physical objects, secrets and sentiments.

While [Angry Letters]({{ site.baseurl }}/angry-letters/) dealt with the materialization of anger, this is the materialization of something else. While in San Francisco, I recorded myself telling personal secrets, industrial secrets and reading my favorite parts from NDA documents of different tech companies based in the greater Silicon Valley region (specially the self-referential parts that specify rules regarding the document itself).

The waveforms from these recordings were then converted into shapes that were inscribed on the inside of 3D-printed eggs. I then tried to hide these eggs back inside chickens, but none of the ones I had agreed to participate.

I am obviously kidding, and no chickens were harmed or involved in the making of this project.
