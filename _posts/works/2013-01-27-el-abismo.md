*El Abismo* is part live performance, part construction of a collective memory of the events that took place during [The Mexican Spring of 2012](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_Soy_132){:target="_blank"}, built by those who participated in the manifestations.

People were invited to participate in the construction of a collective archive of micro-narratives by submitting their images, videos, audio tracks and texts through an online platform, or, much like the original [*Yo Soy 132*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_Soy_132){:target="_blank"} movement, by submitting texts via twitter using a specific hashtag.

The material was organized during a week-long workshop at the Live Performers Meeting 2013 in Mexico City, and the resulting archive was exhibited as a live audio-visual performance during the same festival.

For this performance, I created a platform for live manipulation of a twitter stream. This platform allowed me to build, in real-time, graphical compositions made up of words and phrases from tweets sent with a specific hashtag during the performance. Some of my favorites:
