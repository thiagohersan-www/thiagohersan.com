Ad Infinitum draws a link between our insatiable consumption of social media and the anthropocentric perspective which interprets terrestrial resources (and now, ever increasingly, cosmological resources) as infinite, exploiting them immeasurably. A concrete rock forms a mountain, while underground different minerals become layers of time in an [infinite scroll](https://infinitum.thiagohersan.com/){:target="_blank"}. In search of instant satisfaction, despite all the mundane textures, we dig with our fingers into a database of smooth and endless atmosphere.

In addition to the infinite scroll, a set of [counterfunctional](https://www.jamesjpierce.com/projects/project-d){:target="_blank"} objects was designed to further explore the materiality of our everyday digital footprint. Despite their familiar form factor, the touch-sensitive cement phones are heavy, rough, cracked and only present the shadows of infinite infornmation, in complete opposition to the slick, smooth and glossy techno-positivism associated with our un-resistive flow of information.

This project was developed with [Mari Nagem](https://marinagem.com/){:target="_blank"} during the artistic residency ComCiÃªncia, at the Museum of Mines and Metals in Belo Horizonte, Brazil and later expanded and presented as part of Sala_Taller in the Space for Contemporary Art in Montevideo, Uruguay.
