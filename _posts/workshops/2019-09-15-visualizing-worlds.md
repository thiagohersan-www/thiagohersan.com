Antenna construction workshop for frequency mapping and electromagnetic navigation. This workshop is an expansion of the [Relative Intensity](../relative-intensity/) project.

We start the workshop by introducing the Astrolabe (the Islamic measuring and navigation instrument) and other historical instances of embodied measurement devices and techniques to get a feeling for the performative aspects of science.

After a short presentation about antennas and electromagnetic waves, and a quick tutorial on soldering, participants make their own wearable antennas using copper, brass and semi-precious stones.

Afterwards, each antenna is analyzed to quantify their resonance and measure which frequency bands they amplify or attenuate.
