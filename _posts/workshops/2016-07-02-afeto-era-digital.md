A few months later, the project was reformulated as a two-day workshop for discussing the effects of the internet on the body. After a short presentation about how the internet works and what is behind some of the more popular sites, we talked about how this technology influences our behavior on- and offline.

We then used alginate, silicone rubber and other analog materials to create objects for an (inter)active, presential network. Silicone-cast body parts were by far the most popular objects created, and mouths were by far the most popular body part cast.

Once we had our objects, we performed our network in a town plaza, implicating other objects, humans and animals in our communication rituals.

## Participants
This would not have been possible without the participation of some very special people. From the people who received stamps in the mail, to the people who participated in the workshop, interacted with us in the plaza, contributed to the installation, travelled with stamps, helped produce videos, gave advice, documented...
