In 2014 the [Astrovadalistas](http://astrovandalistas.cc/){:target="_blank"} collective started CoDEPI: Comisión de Discusión sobre el Espacio Público Intangible (Commission for the Discussion of Intangible Public Spaces) to coordinate actions related to telecommunication access and autonomy.

The first set of CoDEPI events was organized in conjunction with the exhibition [Acciones Territoriales](https://accionesterritoriales.blogspot.mx/){:target="_blank"} that took place in November of 2014, at Ex Teresa Arte Actual, in Mexico City. The exhibition proposed to *"explore the concept of territory and resistances through four nodes of investigation: The idea of territory as Nation-State; Resistance through Memory; Navigable and Transitional Territories; and Everyday life: Imaginary, Representation, and Language"*.

The exhibition also coincided with growing [mass protests](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/09/mexico-demonstration-43-students-confirmed-massacred){:target="_blank"} against the kidnapping and disappearance of the [43 Ayotzinapa students](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Iguala_mass_kidnapping){:target="_blank"}. This was a serendipitous complement to our proposed occupation of the city center's virtual territory.

During a 4-day workshop, we worked with writers, journalists, artists, activists, and programmers to prepare a collaborative, temporary, [clickbaiting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait){:target="_blank"} site with critical content about Mexico's telecommunication companies, and the government's proposed telecommunication and energy reform laws. The website was then hosted on a couple of modified WiFi routers, which were distributed throughout the city center, broadcasting the contents of the site on local wireless networks with names like: "Free Internet" and "Free WiFi". Upon joining these networks, which weren't connected to the internet, users would only be able to access our [collaborative site](http://estonoesinternet.astrovandalistas.cc/){:target="_blank"}.
