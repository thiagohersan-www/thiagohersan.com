My work deals with the structures of power embedded in the digital, social 
and biological technologies that we use, and processes for reterritorializing the techniques necessary to shift, intervene and subvert these structures.

I create collaborative objects, situations and devices to contribute to ways of being that are more open to entanglements with other species, histories, epistemologies and technologies.
